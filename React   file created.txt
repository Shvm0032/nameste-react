If we import the react on the our project we will simple use CDN links (cdn react).
'it is not a good way to use react from CDN links'
//
=>React file making by myself
1- npm init 
2-  npm install -D parcel(parcel is a huge library for igniting the our app )

carat(^)and tilde(-)
carat-It is used for upgrading minor updates in the version if in feature new version is come so carat will automatically upgrade the version.
tilde-It is also used for upgrading the version but fro mazor version upgrading .

package.json -It is the configure of npm ,it keeps the trake of what version is install in the app.
package-lock.json-it stores exact version of the package .
node-modules- It is the collection of dependencies.

3- npx parcel index.html(for going on server port localhost:1234)now our app will show on the localhost right now
4- npm install react
5- npm i react-dom
6- npx parcel built index2.html(first remove 'main' entry file from package.json file)
npm run start = npm start

* const header = React.createElement("in this there is a tag e.g-h1,p,etc",{and in this there will object to  be a atrributes for the code e.g-id},"children of the heading as a string and text also ")
* React.createElement(react element) =>js object(its is a object) =>html element(when render on to the dom it change it into html element).

NOTE-We use react without jsx but its clingy or not a good way to make from that so we use JSX it is easy for developer ..(JSX and react are different  they are not same ).
* JSX = html like syntex but not html or javascript or not xml .

--------------COMPARISON CODE---------------

This is core React element for H1 tag--
const heading = React.createElement("h1",{ id: "heading" },"Hey its me SHIVAM");

AND this is in jsx  code the same code---
const jsxheading = <h1 id="heading">Nameste shivam using jsx</h1>
these both are same code 

--------------END COMPARISION--------------------------

BABEL is a javascript compilar and babel is a part of parcel .

jsx =>react element (with help of babel the jsx code convert it into react element)=> html element.

# REACT COMPONENTS:-
1-Class Based COMPONENTS : OLD style for the coding.
2-Functional Based COMPONENTS :NEW style for the coding(It is a just JAVASCRIPT components).

React functional componet is the function which return some peace of JSX code and react element.

If we want to rendered the functional component we simply use '<functional component/>'.

Q1-What is the componet composition ?
Ans.- Components inside another component is called component composition.
